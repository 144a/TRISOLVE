# TRISOLVE

Got another program designed to basically take all the work out of math. This program will ask for the angles and sides of a right triangle, and it will attempt to solve for all remaining unknowns. It works by essentially attempting solve all possibilities, slowly figuring out what it can and can't solve with the current information. To use it, put in numbers for each of the inputs as it asks for them. If said input is unknown, put a -1 in place of that value. If after it finishes, a value is a -1, it means there was not enough information to solve it.

The text files allow for easy observation of the code with out the ti connect editor.
